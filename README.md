## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-system.git
   cd employee-management-system
   ```

2. **Configure Database (MySQL):**

   * Create a new database in MySQL:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
     ```
   * Update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_db
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
     ```

3. **Build and Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   * API endpoints will be available at:

     ```
     http://localhost:8080/api/employees
     ```
